# Manual initialization

Sometimes you may want to initialize tenancy manually — that is, not using web middleware, command traits, queue tenancy etc. A common use case for this is if you need to use artisan tinker for a specific tenant.
For that, use the initialize() method on Stancl\Tenancy\Tenancy. You can resolve the Tenancy instance out of the container using the tenancy() helper.

```php
$tenant = Tenant::find('some-id'); tenancy()->initialize($tenant);
```
